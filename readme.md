# Nowhere Disc

**Nowhere Disc** is an interactive web ring that preserves and shares **abandoned game ideas** — projects that never reached completion, but still carry creative spark.

Each idea is presented as a **virtual game case**, complete with cover art, concept descriptions, and creator reflections. These aren’t cancelled releases — they’re prototypes, sketches, mechanics, or worlds left behind in notebooks, jam folders, and design documents.

## Why Nowhere Disc?

In creative work, ideas often get set aside — not because they’re bad, but because time runs out, scope grows too big, or interest shifts.  
**Nowhere Disc provides a platform for those abandoned ideas to breathe again.**

- The idea you gave up might inspire someone else.
- What felt too big alone might become possible through collaboration.
- A discarded mechanic might find new life in a different genre.

Here, giving up can be a form of revival.
